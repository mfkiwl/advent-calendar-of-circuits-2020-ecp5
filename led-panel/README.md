# Led Panel



---

I was donated a reel of White LEDs, so I figure I should make use of them, This breaks out 48 LEDs on a compact board. Which should run upto around 4W of output power.


## What is it

No controller on this one, it's purely to test an array of LEDs to see if they'll be suitable for some form of lighting attached to a goose-neck
